# GoVYA Application

This Flask application connected with mysql is our attempt at creating a website to "connect manufacturers and shippers". It is meant to be a bridge for easy access, resonable prices and a choice for opportunity between them. Our aim is to develop something that will allow these producers and transporters to connect easily. 

This project was meant to be our fourth semester "Database Management System" course's final project but we are willing to come back and spend time working on this perfecting it and using it as playground for our skills.

This project has been fun and at times hectic, thanks to our last minute efforts, but I'm sure all the creators will cherish these project as an memory in future.
